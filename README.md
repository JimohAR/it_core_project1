**_note that this is a practice project_**

An investor is interested in purchasing an existing mobile service provider, TellCo. TellCo’s current owners are willing to share their data that is generated automatically by their systems.

I am being employed by the investor to analyze opportunities for growth in TellCo based on their data and make a recommendation on whether It is worth buying or not. I will deliver an easy to use web-based dashboard and a written report.

The four (4) global objectives for this project are:

* **User Overview Analysis (task1)** - I will explore the dataset by 
  * identifying useful features
  * performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  * removing outliers
  * performing dimensionality reduction to see how much features can give a good representation of the dataset
  * performing clustering to group users based on their similar features

* **User Engagement Analysis (task2)** - I will track each user’s engagement using the following engagement metrics: 
  * sessions frequency 
  * the duration of all sessions
  * the sessions' total traffic (download and upload)

* **User Experience Analysis (task3)** - In the telecommunication industry, the user experience is related, 
most of the time, to network performance or/and the customers’ device characteristics and quality. 
I will track each customers' experience based on: 
  * network performance metrics recorded and
  * their handset type

* **User Satisfaction Analysis (task4)** - I will provide a score on the level of satisfaction of each customer 
using their user experience and user engagement data
